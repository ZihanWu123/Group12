#The objective of this analysis is to build a supervised classification model that predicts whether a patient has heart disease using various clinical features such as age, cholesterol level, chest pain type, and other diagnostic indicators.
#The target variable, num, is transformed into a binary outcome for classification purposes:

#1 indicates the presence of heart disease

#0 indicates no heart disease
